# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Each milestone contributes to the project's progress and functionality, and we will explore the key concepts, issues, and insights associated with each step. 

Milestone 1: Word List Creation
In the first milestone, a Python script was created to define a list of five favourite fruits and assign it to the 'word_list' variable. This milestone serves as the foundational step by establishing the set of words from which the game selects a secret word. It highlights the importance of initialising data and the concept of using lists to store information.

Milestone 2: Random Word Selection
The second milestone introduced the 'random' module and implemented the 'random.choice' method to select a random word from the 'word_list.' This step demonstrates how to integrate external modules for specific functionalities, emphasising the use of Python's built-in libraries to simplify complex tasks.

Milestone 3: User Input Validation
Milestone 3 addressed user input validation by creating a 'while' loop to continuously prompt the user to guess a letter. It enforced strict validation criteria to ensure that the input is a single alphabetic character. This milestone highlights the significance of user experience and input integrity in game development.

Milestone 4: Check Guess and Ask for Input Functions
Milestone 4 enhanced code organisation by defining two functions: 'check_guess' and 'ask_for_input.' 'check_guess' evaluates if the guessed letter is in the secret word, while 'ask_for_input' manages user interactions and input validation. This step exemplifies code modularity and promotes better code maintenance and readability.

Milestone 5: Play Game Functionality
In the final milestone, the 'play_game' function was created to orchestrate the game's flow. It continuously checks the user's input, validates it, and informs the user if the guess is correct or incorrect. The 'play_game' function brings together the previously developed components into a functional game. It represents the holistic approach to game development by combining various elements to deliver an engaging user experience.

Analysis and Evaluation:
The project demonstrates a deep understanding of Python programming concepts, including data structures, user input handling, and the use of modules. The integration of the 'random' module showcases practical application and aligns with Python's simplicity in implementing complex features. The project's structure enhances code maintainability, readability, and modularity.
